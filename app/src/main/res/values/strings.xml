    <string name="tourist_one">Grant\'s Tomb</string>
    <string name="tourist_two">The Cathedral of St. John the Divine</string>
    <string name="tourist_three">Buell Hall</string>


    <!--Tourist site info-->
    <string name="info_tourist_one">The final resting place of President Ulysses S. Grant and his wife, Julia, is the largest mausoleum in North America. It testifies to a people’s gratitude for the man who ended the bloodiest conflict in American history as Commanding General of the Union Army and then, as President of the United States, strove to heal a nation after a civil war and make rights for all citizens a reality.</string>
    <string name="info_tourist_two">In a city of skyscrapers, the Cathedral impresses with sheer size. Its detailed façade towers over Amsterdam Avenue, and the building extends a full avenue block to Morningside Drive. The Cathedral is more than 120 years old, and remains unfinished. Despite incomplete construction, it is the largest cathedral in the world, making it a global landmark. The Cathedral’s distinctive architecture is an equal claim to fame, and an important monument in the history of its neighborhood and city.</string>
    <string name="info_tourist_three">Buell Hall (also known in the past as College Hall, Alumni House and East Hall)[1], is the only remaining building on the Morningside Heights campus that dates back to Columbia's predecessor on the site, the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. As such, it is the oldest building on campus.</string>
